sf_host_input_agent.pl
================

Description:

The sf_host_input_agent.pl script is a Perl utility that runs on either a
3rd party client or a DC (release 4.9.1 or greater) directly.  It will
retrieve scan data and convert it to host input CSV commands and store
vulnerabilities as a 3rd party scanner on a DC.

sf_host_input_agent Syntax:

sf_host_input_agent.pl [options] <plugin>

Options:
- server: The server's (DC) IP address or hostname.
- port: The server port to connect to. The default port is 8307.
- ipv6: Enable IPv6 capability when connecting to DC. Enabling this will switch
        communications to IPv6 only.
- pkcs12: The pathname to the pkcs12 file. The default is to
        auto-detect the pkcs12 file in the current directory.
- password: Specify a password for the pkcs12, if there is one. The
        default is no password.
- syslog: Enable logging to syslog. If there is no Sys::Syslog installed/defined in OS
         (like Windows system), this will be replaced by stderr.
- stderr: Enable logging to STDERR.
- logfile: Specify a log file pathname to capture logging output. The
         default is no log file.
- level: Specify a log level (3: debug, 2: info, 1: warning, 0: error)
         The default is 2 (info).
- runondc: Specify this utility is run from DC or not ('y' or 'n'). The default is 'n'.
- csvfile: Specify a CSV output pathname. If a CSV file is specified, converted commands
        will be saved as a file, not sending/running over DC. The
        default is no CSV file is saved..
- plugininfo: This parameter is specific for each plugin. It can be any string
              passed into plugin module.

Requirements:

      This script requires that you have the third party Perl module
      IO::Socket::SSL, IO::Socket::INET6 and all of its prerequisites
      installed.

      The 'QualysGuard' plugin requires XML::Simple, XML::Twig,
      Net::IP, YAML::XS and LWP::UserAgent Perl modules to be
      installed.

      You MUST follow the directions in the Host Input API Guide for
      issuing a certificate to the client.

      The basic command line steps are as follows:

         ssh as root into DC
         cd /tmp
         execute add_client [ IP address of client system ]
         copy the resulting .pkcs12 to the HostInput client system
